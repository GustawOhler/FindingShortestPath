First enter number number of points and number of paths between them. Then write all 
the paths in this scheme:
numberOfPoint1 numberOfPoint2 distanceBetweenThem.
Program will return first and then second shortest path from first point to the last or "#" if 
there is no 2 shortest ways (for example when there is only one).

Unfortunately all of code is written in polish.
